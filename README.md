# Nike Shoes Store Website

Hi welcome to my personalized shoe repository. ItÂ´s a shoe website. I wanted to create a sophisticated single-page application. It was built using core web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. This project shows a minimalist design enriched with fluid animations powered by the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library. It is a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Project Overview

The website is meticulously crafted to facilitate effortless navigation through distinct sections: Men, Women, Kids, and Collections. Each section meticulously curates the latest Nike products, with a spotlight on the Nike Air Max Plus. This flagship item is meticulously detailed to highlight its cutting-edge design, advanced features, and competitive pricing.
